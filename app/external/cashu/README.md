*Disclaimer: The author is NOT a cryptographer and this work has not been reviewed. This means that there is very likely a fatal flaw somewhere. Cashu is still experimental and not production-ready.*

Cashu is an Ecash implementation based on David Wagner's variant of Chaumian blinding ([protocol specs](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts)). Token logic based on [minicash](https://github.com/phyro/minicash) ([description](https://gist.github.com/phyro/935badc682057f418842c72961cf096c)) which implements a [Blind Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange](https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1996/03/msg01848.html) scheme written down [here](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/be7a4760dd4596d06963d67baf140406). The database mechanics and the Lightning backend uses parts from [LNbits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-legend).

### Feature overview

- Full Bitcoin Lightning support
- Standalone CLI wallet and mint server
- Mint library includable into other Python projects
- PostgreSQL and SQLite database support
- Builtin Tor for hiding IPs for wallet and mint interactions
- Multimint wallet for tokens from different mints
- Send tokens to nostr pubkeys

## Cashu client protocol
There are ongoing efforts to implement alternative Cashu clients that use the same protocol. If you are interested in helping with Cashu development, please refer to the protocol specs [protocol specs](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts).

## Easy Install

The easiest way to use Cashu is to install the package it via pip:
```bash
pip install cashu
```

To update Cashu, use `pip install cashu -U`.

If you have problems running the command above on Ubuntu, run `sudo apt install -y pip pkg-config` and `pip install wheel`. On macOS, you might have to run `pip install wheel` and `brew install pkg-config`.

You can skip the entire next section about Poetry and jump right to [Using Cashu](#using-cashu).

## Hard install: Poetry
These steps help you install Python via pyenv and Poetry. If you already have Poetry running on your computer, you can skip this step and jump right to [Install Cashu](#poetry-install-cashu).

#### Poetry: Prerequisites

```bash
# on ubuntu:
sudo apt install -y build-essential pkg-config libffi-dev libpq-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev python3-dev libsqlite3-dev ncurses-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev lzma-dev

# install python using pyenv
curl https://pyenv.run | bash

# !! follow the instructions of pyenv init to setup pyenv !!
pyenv init

# restart your shell (or source your .rc file), then install python:
pyenv install 3.9.13

# install poetry
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
echo export PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
#### Poetry: Install Cashu
```bash
# install cashu
git clone https://github.com/callebtc/cashu.git --recurse-submodules
cd cashu
pyenv local 3.9.13
poetry install
```

#### Poetry: Update Cashu
To update Cashu to the newest version enter
```bash
git pull && poetry install
```
#### Poetry: Using Cashu

Cashu should be now installed. To execute the following commands, activate your virtual Poetry environment via

```bash
poetry shell
```

If you don't activate your environment, just prepend `poetry run` to all following commands.
## Configuration
```bash
mv .env.example .env
# edit .env file
vim .env
```

To use the wallet with the [public test mint](#test-instance), you need to change the appropriate entries in the `.env` file.

#### Test instance
*Warning: this instance is just for demonstration only. The server could vanish at any moment so consider any Satoshis you deposit a donation.*

Change the appropriate `.env` file settings to
```bash
MINT_HOST=8333.space
MINT_PORT=3338
```

# Using Cashu
```bash
cashu info
```

Returns:
```bash
Version: 0.9.2
Debug: False
Cashu dir: /home/user/.cashu
Wallet: wallet
Mint URL: https://8333.space:3338
```

#### Check balance
```bash
cashu balance
```

#### Generate a Lightning invoice

This command will return a Lightning invoice that you need to pay to mint new ecash tokens.

```bash
cashu invoice 420
```

The client will check every few seconds if the invoice has been paid. If you abort this step but still pay the invoice, you can use the command `cashu invoice <amount> --hash <hash>`.

#### Pay a Lightning invoice
```bash
cashu pay lnbc120n1p3jfmdapp5r9jz...
```

#### Send tokens
To send tokens to another user, enter
```bash
cashu send 69
```
You should see the encoded token. Copy the token and send it to another user such as via email or a messenger. The token looks like this:
```bash
eyJwcm9vZnMiOiBbey...
```

You can now see that your available balance has dropped by the amount that you reserved for sending if you enter `cashu balance`:
```bash
Balance: 420 sat
```

#### Receive tokens
To receive tokens, another user enters:
```bash
cashu receive eyJwcm9vZnMiOiBbey...
```
You should see the balance increase:
```bash
Balance: 0 sat
Balance: 69 sat
```


# Running a mint
This command runs the mint on your local computer. Skip this step if you want to use the [public test mint](#test-instance) instead.
```bash
python -m cashu.mint
```

You can turn off Lightning support and mint as many tokens as you like by setting `LIGHTNING=FALSE` in the `.env` file.
