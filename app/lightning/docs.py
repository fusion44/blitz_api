If neither __target_conf__, or __sat_per_vbyte__ are set, then the internal wallet will consult its fee model to determine a fee for the default confirmation target.

* Set __target_conf__ ==1: interpreted as urgent (aim for next block)
* Set __target_conf__ >=2: interpreted as normal (next 4 blocks or so, **default**)
* Set __target_cont__ >=10: interpreted as slow (next 100 blocks or so)
* If __sat_per_vbyte__ is set then __target_conf__ is ignored and vbytes (sipabytes) will be used.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Keep the following points in mind when sending all onchain funds:

* If __send_all__ is set to __true__, the __amount__ field must be set to __0__.
* If the __amount__ field is greater than __0__, the __send_all__ field must be __false__.
  * The API will return an error if neither or both conditions are met at the same time.
* If __send_all__ is set to __true__ the amount of satoshis to send will be calculated by subtracting the fee from the wallet balance.
* If the wallet balance is not sufficient to cover the fee, the call will fail.
* The call will __not__ close any channels.
* The implementation may keep a reserve of funds if there are still open channels.
