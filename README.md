## Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your `bitcoind` and `lnd` configuration. See the `.env_sample` file for all configuration options.

### Dependencies

- [Python in version 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io)
- [Polar](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar)
  If you need an easy option to run a simple bitcoind & lnd client

## Installation

⚠️ To setup a development environment for BlitzAPI skip to the [Development](#Development) section.

### Linux / macOS

```sh
make install
```

or

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Windows

```sh
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the application

### Linux / macOS

```sh
make run
```

or

```sh
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Windows

```sh
py -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Development

It is recommended to have [python-poetry installed](<(https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installation)>).

From within the `blitz_api` folder [open a poetry shell](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/cli/#shell) via:

```sh
poetry shell
```

(To exit the poetry shell use: `exit`)

### Installation

```
poetry install
pre-commit install
```

or

```sh
make install-dev
```

If python dependencies have been changed it's necessary to freeze all requirements to requirements.txt:

```sh
poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt
```

> ℹ️ This will skip all dev dependencies by default.\
> This step is required to avoid having to install poetry for final deployment.

### Sync changes to a RaspiBlitz

Create a file `/script/sync_to_blitz.personal.sh` (will be ignored by github) the SSH connection data to your RaspiBlitz.

localIP="192.168.178.61"
sshPort="22"
passwordA=""

Then you can run always `make sync-to-blitz` to copy your latest code over to your RaspiBlitz. The script automatically restarts the backend API with the new code on your RaspiBlitz and shows you the logs.

To test the backend API then call the SwaggerUI: `http://[LOCALIP]/api/v1/docs` - to call protected endpoints run the `/system/login` endpoint first with HTTP POST body:
```
{
  "password": "[PASSWORDA]"
}
```
and then copy the JWT Auth string returned to `Authorize` in the top section of the SwaggerUI.

*You can also now test the RaspiBlitz WebUI against the API by running it locally on your dev laptop when you configure it to use the backend API of your RaspiBlitz.*

### Unit / Integration testing

Make sure to include tests for important pieces of submitted code.

#### Run the tests with pytest

```sh
make test
```

#### Run tests and generate a coverage

```sh
make coverage
```

This will run tests and generate a coverage html file in this folder: `./htmlcov`

### Client libraries

> ℹ️ The client libraries live in an extra repository:
https://github.com/fusion44/blitz_api_client_libraries

#### Generating client libraries
Install [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) and Java:


```sh
npm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli -g
sudo apt install default-jre
```


Clone https://github.com/fusion44/blitz_api_client_libraries next to the blitz_api folder.

```sh
make generate-client-libs
```
> ⚠️ The first run requires `sudo` as it must download a Java .jar file to the system npm package folder.

### Before you commit

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to keep the source code structured. Please make sure to run either `make pre_commit` or `pre-commit run --all-files`. The CI pipeline will reject pull requests that fail this step. This step helps to ensures that the source code is formatted consistently and pull requests are as tidy as possible.

### [Swagger / OpenAPI](https://swagger.io)

Once the API is running swagger docs can be found here:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/latest/docs
```

### Useful cURL commands to test the API

```sh
curl -N -H "Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN_HERE" http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse/subscribe
```

```sh
curl -N -H "Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN_HERE" http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/bitcoin/getblockchaininfo
```

```sh
curl -X POST -N http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/setup/type/1
```

```sh
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"password":"12345678"}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/system/login
```
